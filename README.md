# Articles

This folder contains a chronological archive of written thoughts, reflections, and articles. Each piece of writing is timestamped by the date it was created, creating a living journal of your intellectual journey.

## Organization

Articles are organized in a strict chronological hierarchy: `YYYY/MM/DD/`. This date-first approach makes it easy to:
- Review all thoughts from a specific day
- Track the evolution of your ideas over time
- Search your archive by time period
- Maintain a natural, sequential narrative of your thinking

## Writing Practices

### Frequency & Length
- Write as frequently as inspiration strikes—daily, weekly, or spontaneously
- Articles can be short reflections (100 words) or longer essays (2000+ words)
- Quality over quantity: one thoughtful piece beats rushed daily entries

### Structure Tips
- **Headlines**: Use clear, descriptive titles that capture your article's essence
- **Frontmatter**: Consider adding metadata like tags, mood, or themes at the top
- **Sections**: Break longer articles into logical sections with headers
- **Links**: Reference related articles from other dates using relative markdown links

### Content Ideas
- Morning or evening reflections on the day's events
- Deep dives into ideas, technologies, or concepts you're exploring
- Personal growth reflections and lessons learned
- Analysis and critique of books, articles, or projects
- Creative writing, poetry, or experimental forms of expression
- Project post-mortems and technical documentation

## Browsing Your Archive

To explore your past thoughts:
- **By Date**: Navigate directly to `articles/YYYY/MM/DD/`
- **By Year**: Review yearly patterns in `articles/YYYY/`
- **By Season**: Group months mentally (Q1: 01-03, Q2: 04-06, etc.)
- **Search**: Use your editor's search function to find articles by keyword across all dates

## File Naming

- Use **kebab-case** (lowercase with hyphens): `morning-thoughts.md`, `2026-ai-predictions.md`
- Be descriptive: filenames should indicate content at a glance
- Avoid generic names like `article.md` or `thoughts.md` when multiple pieces exist on the same day
- Include context when helpful: `book-review-atomic-habits.md`, `project-retrospective-website.md`

## Best Practices

- **Commit regularly**: Push changes after writing significant pieces to preserve your work
- **Review periodically**: Spend time reading your past articles to spot patterns and growth
- **Update older pieces sparingly**: Keep articles as-is to preserve your authentic thinking at that moment
- **Create cross-references**: Link related articles across dates to build thematic connections
- **Maintain consistency**: Use similar formatting and structure across articles for easier reading

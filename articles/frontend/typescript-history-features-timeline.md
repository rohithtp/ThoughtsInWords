# TypeScript History, Features, and Timeline

**Date:** February 09, 2026

## Summary

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transpile to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

## History

TypeScript's development began at Microsoft in 2010, led by Anders Hejlsberg, the architect of C#, Delphi, and Turbo Pascal. The project aimed to address the shortcomings of JavaScript for large-scale application development.

### Timeline

*   **2010**: Development begins internally at Microsoft.

*   **October 2012 (v0.8)**: TypeScript was first released to the public. It introduced the core concepts of the language: structural typing, type inference, and class-based object-oriented programming.

*   **2013 (v0.9)**: Released with support for generics.

*   **2014 (v1.0)**: The first stable release, announced at Microsoft's Build conference. It replaced the original compiler with a new one written in TypeScript itself.

*   **September 2016 (v2.0)**: Introduced null safety (non-nullable types), control flow analysis, and tagged unions.

*   **July 2018 (v3.0)**: Added project references and unknown type.

*   **August 2020 (v4.0)**: Brought variadic tuple types and labeled tuple elements.

*   **March 2023 (v5.0)**: Major performance improvements, decorators standard, and smaller bundle size.

## Key Features

TypeScript enhances JavaScript with several powerful features that improve developer productivity and code quality.

1.  **Static Typing**: The most significant feature. It allows defining types for variables, functions, and objects, enabling errors to be caught at compile-time rather than runtime.

2.  **Interfaces**: define contracts within your code and passing compilation.

3.  **Classes**: TypeScript offers full support for class-based object-oriented programming, including inheritance, modifiers (public, private, protected), and abstract classes.

4.  **Generics**: Allow creating reusable components that work with a variety of types rather than a single one.

5.  **Enums**: A way of giving more friendly names to sets of numeric values.

6.  **Type Inference**: TypeScript can often infer types without explicit annotations, keeping code concise.

7.  **Tooling Support**: Because of static typing, IDEs can provide better autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring capabilities.

## Conclusion

TypeScript has grown from an internal Microsoft project to one of the most popular programming languages in the world. By adding static types and modern features to JavaScript, it has become an essential tool for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

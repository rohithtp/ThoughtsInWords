# File Over App: A Manifesto for Digital Longevity

**Date:** February 04, 2026

## Summary

In an era where software comes and goes, subscriptions rise, and platforms sunset without warning, the "File Over App" philosophy has emerged as a crucial stance for digital data ownership. Championed by Steph Ango of Obsidian and adopted by the "tools for thought" community, this manifesto prioritizes the longevity and accessibility of user data over the ephemeral nature of the applications used to create it. It argues that while apps are temporary tools, the files they produce should be enduring artifacts, accessible for decades to come.

## The Problem with "App First"

Most modern software locks data into proprietary databases or cloud silos. When you use a typical note-taking app or project management tool, your data exists only within that walled garden.
- **Vendor Lock-in:** You cannot easily move your data to another tool.
- **Obsolescence:** If the startup fails or the product is discontinued, your data disappears.
- **Inaccessibility:** You cannot open your notes with a standard text editor or script; you need *their* app.

## The "File Over App" Philosophy

The core tenet is simple: **Software should treat files as the primary source of truth, not a hidden database.**

When an application adopts this approach:
1.  **Files are Universal:** Data is stored in open, human-readable formats like Markdown (`.md`), JSON, or plain text.
2.  **You Own the Data:** The files live on *your* file system, not on a company's server (unless you choose to sync them there).
3.  **Portability:** You can open the same file in Obsidian, VS Code, iA Writer, or even Notepad. If one app stops satisfying you, you swap the app, but keep the files.

## Key Principles

### 1. Longevity
"If you want your notes to last for 50 years, do not use a proprietary format."
The goal is to create digital artifacts that outlive the tools used to create them. A text file from the 1970s is still readable today. A proprietary database file from 1995 likely is not.

### 2. Local-First
Data should reside on the user's device first. Cloud usage should be for sync or backup, but the primary copy is yours, locally. This ensures access even without an internet connection or if the service provider goes down.

### 3. Interoperability
By using standard formats (like Markdown for text), different tools can work on the same data. One tool might be great for writing, another for linking, and a third for publishing—all operating on the same set of files.

## Conclusion

The "File Over App" movement is a shift towards digital autonomy. It reminds us that tools are merely instruments to shape our thoughts and work, but the work itself—the file—is what matters. By choosing tools that respect the file system, we ensure that our digital heritage remains ours, regardless of what software trends come and go.

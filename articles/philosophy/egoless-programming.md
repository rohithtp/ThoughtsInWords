## Summary

Egoless programming is a software development philosophy introduced by Gerald M. Weinberg in his 1971 book, *The Psychology of Computer Programming*.

It emphasizes that software development is a **social activity**. Programmers should detach their ego from their code to improve quality and team collaboration.

## Key Concepts

The core idea is that personal ego can hinder the detection of errors and the improvement of software. By accepting that code is independent of the creator's self-worth, developers become more open to:

*   Constructive criticism
*   Peer reviews
*   Collective ownership

## The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming

1.  **Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.**
    The point is to find them early, before the end user does.

2.  **You are not your code.**
    Remember that the entire point of a review is to find problems, and problems *will* be found. Don't take it personally.

3.  **No matter how much "karate" you know, someone else will always know more.**
    Such an individual can teach you some new moves if you ask.

4.  **Don't rewrite code without consultation.**
    There's a fine line between "fixing code" and "rewriting code." Know the difference, and pursue stylistic changes within the framework of a code review, not as a lone wolf.

5.  **Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.**
    Nontechnical people who deal with developers often view them as prima donnas. Don't reinforce this stereotype with anger and impatience.

6.  **The only constant in the world is change.**
    Be open to it and accept it with a smile. Look at each change to your requirements, platform, or tool as a new challenge, not as a serious inconvenience.

7.  **The only true authority stems from knowledge, not from position.**
    Knowledge spawns authority, and authority spawns respect. If you want respect in an egoless environment, cultivate knowledge.

8.  **Fight for what you believe, but gracefully accept defeat.**
    Understand that sometimes your ideas will be overruled. Even if you turn out to be right, don't say, "I told you so."

9.  **Don't be "the guy in the room."**
    Don't be the developer coding in a dark office, emerging only for soda. The "guy in the room" is out of touch and out of place in a collaborative environment.

10. **Critique code instead of people.**
    Be kind to the coder, not to the code. Keep comments positive and oriented toward improving the code (standards, performance, etc.).

## Conclusion

Adopting an egoless mindset fosters a healthier work environment where the focus is on the **quality of the product** rather than individual accolades. It turns programming into a collaborative effort where everyone learns and improves together.

## Unique Features to Look For

*   **Alternate Travel Plan:** Found on **ConfirmTkt** and **ixigo**, this is a "backup" service. If your ticket isn't confirmed by chart preparation, they help you book a bus or flight and often provide a higher refund than IRCTC alone.
*   **Vikalp Scheme:** Most of these apps now integrate the official IRCTC **VIKALP** option, which allows you to opt for confirmation on *other* trains running on the same route if your primary choice is full.
*   **Station Alarms:** **ixigo** and **RailYatri** offer destination alarms that wake you up or alert you when your station is approaching based on live GPS location.

## How to Use Prediction Apps Effectively

To maximize your chances of securing a seat:

1.  **PNR Entry:** Copy your 10-digit PNR number from your IRCTC booking.
2.  **Cross-Check:** If one app says "Medium" and another says "High," look at the **historical trends** (usually available on Trainman) to see how many people typically cancel on that route.
3.  **Wait for the "Final Chart":** No app can give a 100% guarantee. The final status is only decided 4 hours before the train's departure from the source station.

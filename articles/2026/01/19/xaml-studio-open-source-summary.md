# ## Microsoft Open Sources XAML Studio: Empowering Rapid Prototyping for the WinUI Community
In a significant move for the Windows developer community, Microsoft has officially open-sourced **XAML Studio**, a popular tool used for rapid prototyping of UWP (Universal Windows Platform) XAML interfaces.

The announcement, as detailed by SD Times, marks a new chapter for a project that began nearly a decade ago. Here is a review and summary of the key highlights:

### **Summary of the Announcement**

* **Purpose of XAML Studio:** Originally created in 2017 during a hackathon (then called *XamlPad+*), the tool allows developers to quickly prototype UI layouts, test data bindings, and preview designs in real-time before moving the code into Visual Studio.
* **Key Features:** The tool provides a suite of resources for XAML development, including:
* **Live Preview & Interaction:** Real-time editing of UI components.
* **Binding Debugger & Data Context Editor:** Tools to troubleshoot data flow.
* **IntelliSense & Namespace Helpers:** Support for faster, error-free coding.
* **Documentation Toolbox:** Integrated guides and alignment tools.


* **Open Source Transition:** While the project has been public since 2018, the move to full open source has been a multi-year effort. Individual components (like the Monaco Editor Wrapper and various Sizer controls) were released first, followed by the complete platform.
* **Future Development:** XAML Studio is now a "seed project" under the **.NET Foundation**. Work is currently underway on **Version 2**, which aims to stabilize experimental features and provide better support for **WinUI 3**.

### **Review & Impact**

The decision to open-source XAML Studio is a win for the **WinUI and UWP ecosystems**. By handing the project to the community under the .NET Foundation, Microsoft ensures the tool's longevity even as internal priorities shift.

For developers, this move means more transparency and the ability to contribute directly to the roadmap. While the maintainers have stated that no major new "tooling features" are currently planned, the focus on refactoring and backend stability for Version 2 suggests that the tool will become more robust and integrated with modern Windows development standards (like WinUI 3) through community collaboration.

## **Atmospheric Water Generation: Defense Against Air Pollution and pH Imbalance**

---

### **Overview**

This document outlines the technical challenges and defensive measures required for **Atmospheric Water Generation (AWG)** in environments with high air pollution and acidic atmospheric conditions.

### **The Multi-Stage Defense Architecture**

To ensure water safety when the air pH is compromised, the system utilizes a series of protective barriers.

1. **Air Filtration (Inbound Defense):** * **HEPA Filters:** Capture particulate matter (PM2.5) that often carries acidic sulfates.
* **Activated Carbon:** Neutralizes gaseous pollutants before they can dissolve into the condensate.


2. **Condensation Control:** * Specialized non-leaching coatings on heat exchangers prevent heavy metal contamination in acidic environments.
3. **Post-Condensation Correction:**
* **Remineralization:** The primary defense against low pH. By passing water through calcite or magnesium media, the system restores a healthy, alkaline balance.
* **UV/Ozone:** Final sterilization to eliminate bio-aerosols.

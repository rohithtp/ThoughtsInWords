# ThoughtsInWords

A personal repository for organizing and archiving written thoughts, reflections, and articles organized chronologically by date.

## Purpose

ThoughtsInWords is a structured space for capturing daily thoughts, ideas, articles, and reflections. Each piece of writing is organized by the date it was created, making it easy to look back and review your thoughts across time.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the date folder for today: `articles/YYYY/MM/DD/`
2. Create markdown files for your thoughts (e.g., `morning-thoughts.md`, `reflection.md`)
3. Commit your work to preserve your thoughts over time

## Naming Convention

- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames: `my-article-title.md`
- For multiple articles on the same day, use descriptive names:
  - `morning-reflection.md`
  - `evening-thoughts.md`
  - `ideas.md`

# ThoughtsInWords

A personal repository for organizing and archiving written thoughts, reflections, and articles.

## Purpose

ThoughtsInWords is a structured space for capturing daily thoughts, ideas, articles, and reflections.

## Organization

Articles are organized by **topic** (tags) rather than chronologically. This aligns with a "digital garden" approach where content is grouped by context.

```

├── README.md           # This file
├── ai/                 # Artificial Intelligence & ML

├── environment/        # Climate & Environmental reports
├── frontend/           # Web development & frameworks
├── licensing/          # Open source licensing
├── philosophy/         # Tech philosophy & fables
├── testing/            # QA & Testing strategies
└── tools/              # Productivity & Developer tools
```

## Digital Garden Approach

Unlike a traditional blog where posts are static and ordered by date, ThoughtsInWords follows the **Digital Garden** philosophy:

*   **Growth over time**: Articles are not "finished" upon publication. They are seeds that grow as new information is learned and added.
*   **Contextual Organization**: Content is linked and grouped by topic (tags) rather than purely by timestamps, making it easier to explore related ideas.
*   **Evolution**: Some notes may start as rough thoughts (seedlings) and evolve into comprehensive guides (evergreens).
*   **Interconnectivity**: Heavy use of internal linking connects disparate ideas, fostering a network of knowledge rather than a stream of updates.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the relevant tag folder (e.g., `articles/devops/`).
2. Create a new markdown file: `my-topic.md`.

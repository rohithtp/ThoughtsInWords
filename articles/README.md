- `articles/2026/02/15/` - Articles written on February 15, 2026
- `articles/2026/03/01/` - Articles written on March 1, 2026

## Usage

1. Create a folder for today's date if it doesn't exist
2. Add your article files (e.g., `article.md`, `my-thoughts.md`) inside the date folder
3. Each date folder can contain multiple articles

## Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case for article filenames: `my-article-title.md`
- For multiple articles on the same day, use descriptive names: `morning-thoughts.md`, `evening-reflection.md`
